	This xhtml document is marked up to provide the designer with the maximum possible flexibility.
	There are more classes and extraneous tags than needed, and in a real world situation, it's more
	likely that it would be much leaner.
	
	However, I think we can all agree that even given that, we're still better off than if this had been
	built with tables.

  <p class    ="p2"><span class="p2">Irina Pelman received a bachelor degree from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_Stolyarsky">Stolyarsky Music School for Gifted Youth</a> in her native city of Odessa, Ukraine. <img src="inlesson.jpg" align="right" padding="5" border="1" />She then went on to receive her master's degree under professor G. Pekker at the <a href="http://www.nsglinka.ru/" target="_blank">Novosibirsk Conservatory of Music</a> in Russia. (The link is in Russian, but translation is available at the bottom of the page.)</span></p>

		  <p class="p3"><span class="p3">She performed as a soloist with symphony orchestras in Russia, particularly such beautiful and technically difficult pieces as the Dvorak Concerto, Rococo Variations by Tchaikovsky and the Concerto-Symphony by Prokofiev.
She also performed widely in festivals and chamber music competitions in Russia.<br /><br />

At the age of 20 Irina began her teaching career in music schools and college, continuing the reknowned tradition of Russian music pedagogy. While working at <a href="http://nsmsh.ru/en/">Novosibirsk Music College</a>, where she was the head of the string department, she also gave master classes and lectured at music conferences. She has taught in Russia, Ukraine, Israel and USA, always with excellent professional results. Her students have gone on to receive bachelors and masters degrees in music.</span></p>
